Training Coach
--------------
To be put into tasks/issues:

_SHORT TERM TASKS_:
 * use TrainingTimer instead of just using wait implementations
 * have a Util class (for methods like wait())
 * refactor start() methods
 * fix the break periods for repetitions/series exercises (implement an infinite wait until user trigger)
 * write tests
 * improve speech for exercises like "jab cross left body punch right body punch left hook uppercut"
 * add more feedback
   * countdown when nearing the end of the exercise / breaks
   * displayed countdown during the exercise
 * improve countdown (seems longer than 1 second between each count (e.g. 3..2..1..), fix by having an async speech maybe?)

_LONG TERM TASKS_:
 * implement persistency for programs
 * implement possibilities of modifying programs
 * implement possibilities of deleting programs
 * implement possibility of tracking performance in each exercise

_PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS_:
 * long waiting in gyms for machines will discrupt training
   * allow to pause the program
   * allow reorganization among training blocks (drag and drop)

_MONETIZATION POSSIBILITIES AND OTHER VISIONS_:
 * free install, free creation of 3 plans, then charge per plan addition (new plans packages)
 * charge for training plans created by professionals
 * charge for some training statistics on the user
 * share training plans among other users
 * gym recommendations based on location/training type/reviews/etc.
 * specific voices: Mr.T is your trainer (possible to modify the text-to-speech? if not, then sell pre-made plans)
